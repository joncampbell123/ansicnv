ANSI graphics/animation utility code.

Code to work with graphics and ANSI animations in DEC VT100
encoding, a terminal standard that was widely popular up
until the late 90s.

MS-DOS had an implementation (ANSI.SYS) too.

The first intent is to develop tools that my site (hackipedia.org)
can use to display ANSI graphics and animations in multiple formats
compatible with the browser.
